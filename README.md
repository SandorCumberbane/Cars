# Cars
SQL and Python Project involving cars in the Austrian market.

## SQL
There are three tables, where the tables cars and customers are connected through orders. To access information querries are made. 

## Python
Idea: access database in Jupyter Notebook and merge the relevant tables. Then perform nice EDA on it. Finally build an interactive streamlit app. Here there are visualizations but also one can add cars, customers and orders.
